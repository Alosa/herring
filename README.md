# Herring

This is an Rstudio project that is currently under development.
It contains code useful for doing genetic stock identification of 
herring species on the east coast.  


It has been designed so that if we decide to it will be
easy to turn this into an R package.  However, at this point
I don't think all the collaborators have the tools necessary to
build packags.
